		<h1>A diary of my journey from when I first met my owners</h1>

		<h3>Day Zero</h3>
			<p>Hi my name is Luigi and I am a 8 month old English Springer Spaniel who is house traind and very lovable. I like to say hello to everyone I meet </p>
			
		<h3>Day One</h3>
			<p>Today I met my new owners- first impressions: they seem very nice and I now have a very comfortable bean bag to relax. 
			</p>

		<h3>Day Two</h3>
			<p>My owners took me to explore my new surroundings and I must say it is very comfortable.</p>
	
		<h3>Day Three</h3>
		<p>Went for a stroll around the park only to discover that there was a Beach Rugy competition being held- looks fun</p>
