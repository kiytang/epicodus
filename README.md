###Task:
Add columns and rows to your vacation page.
To complete this section I implemented Bootstrap "Example: Stacked-to-horizontal" code into my 'Vaction' web page. To furhter highlight the difference in rows and columns, I assigned specfic colors as folows:
- .col-md-1: blue
- .col-md-4: white
- .col-md-6: yellow
- .col-md-8: green
