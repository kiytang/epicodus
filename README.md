###Task:
- Add columns and rows to your vacation page.
To complete this section I implemented Bootstrap "Example: Stacked-to-horizontal" code into my 'Vaction' web page. To furhter highlight the difference in rows and columns, I assigned specfic colors as folows:
- .col-md-1 {
    color: blue;
}
- .col-md-4 {
    color: white;
}

- .col-md-6 {
    color: yellow;
}
- .col-md-8 {
    color: green;
}

##Day 14
###Task:

- Rework one of your existing pages to use Bootstrap's grid.
For theis task I made use of Bootstraps's ".col-md-4", to include three subject topics:
- How I construct my day
- Nutrtional Values
- What I am currently Reading

**What I learnt:
Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
