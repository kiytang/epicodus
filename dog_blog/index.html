		<h3 class="dog">Day One</h3>
			<p class="first_day">Today I met my new owners- first impressions: they seem very nice and I now have a very <em>comfortable</em> bean bag to relax. 
			</p>

		<h3>Day Two</h3>
			<p class="happy">My owners took me to explore my new surroundings and I must say it is very relaxing. Located within walking distance are parks and river terraces</p>

		<h3 class="dog">Day Three</h3>
		<p>Went for a stroll around the park only to discover that there was a Beach Rugy competition being held-looks kindda fun</p>
