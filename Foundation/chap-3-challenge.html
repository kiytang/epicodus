        <h2>A neighborhood of intellect, art, and culture</h2>
        <p><img src="img/paris.jpg" class="right">The Latin Quarter is considered the intellectual center of Paris, and was named at a time when all students and professors of the Sorbonne University spoke Latin. Today it’s home to a dizzying array of intellectual venues including bookstores, schools, churches, and publishing houses. A scattering of Roman ruins, including the Pantheon, and other historical architecture and monuments, including the Fontaine Saint-Michel, also characterize the Latin Quarter.</p>

        <p><img src="img/parismap.jpg" class="left">Some of the delights of the region include gourmet food and wine tastings, as well as tours of favorite haunts frequented by famous writers and other intellects, including Ernest Hemingway, Oscar Wilde, and Gertrude Stein, to name a few. Walking tours of historical churches, some dating back as early as the 12th Century, including the St. Germaine des Prés Abbey and the Church of the Cordelier’s, are also aplenty. In addition, the Cordelier’s Monastery, adjacent to the church, houses the Museum of Popular Art and Tradition, a must-see for anyone interested in the art and culture of the region.</p>
