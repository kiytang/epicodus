		<h1>How to tell apart Greenland and Iceland</h1>
		<h2>It's not easy, but I will teach you</h2>

		<p>If you are like me, you can never keep those two islands straight. But here is a foolproof trick so that you never embarass yourself by mixing them up again</p>

		<div class="countries">
			<h2>Greenland:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Capital: Nuuk</li>
					<li>Officia Language: Kalaallisut</li>
					<li>Ethinc group majority: Greenlandic Inuit</li>
					<li>Sovereign state: Denmark</li>
				</ul>
				<p>'When you've seen the world there's always Greenland. It was the early Scandinavian settlers who gave the country the name Greenland. In the Icelandic sagas, it is said that the Norwegian-born Icelander "Erik the <span class="eric">Red</span>" was exiled from Iceland for manslaughter. Along with his extended family and his thralls, he set out in ships to explore icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it Grœnland (translated as "Greenland"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.The name of the country in Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) is Kalaallit Nunaat ("land of the Kalaallit"). The Kalaallit are the indigenous Greenlandic Inuit people who inhabit the country's western region.</p>
			
			<h2>Iceland</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Capital: Reykjavik</li>
					<li>Officia Language: Icelandic</li>
				</ul>
